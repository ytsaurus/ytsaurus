//! responsible for grouping alerts with the same stage-publish cycle, as well as managing the corresponding gauges.
//! Different logical components and regular processes with differing periods should use different collectors.
//! Alerts from different collectors can share the same category, in which case they will be grouped together by the alert manager into a single aggregated alert.
