 *
 *  Executing any such request requires syncing with certain master cells and
 *  replicating those transactions that haven't yet been replicated here. A
 *  replication session does all that.
 *
 *  NB: ordinarily, these sessions should not be used directly; instead an
 *  all-in-one |RunTransactionReplicationSession| functions should be used. A
 *  direct use should be reserved for special cases like handling batch requests
 *  and minimizing automaton thread usage.
