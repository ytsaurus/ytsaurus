{% endcut %}


{% cut "**1.2.0**" %}

**Release date:** 2023-09-18


- Fixed a bug that caused `SyncTableReaderImpl` internal threads would not terminate.
- In the `WriteTable` request, the `needRetries` option is set to `true` by default.
- The `WriteTable` request has `builder(Class)` now; using it, you can omit the `SerializationContext` if the class is marked with the `@Entity` annotation, implements the `com.google.protobuf.Message` or `tech.ytsaurus.ysontree.YTreeMapNode` interface (serialization formats will be `skiff`, `protobuf` or `wire` respectively).
- The `setPath(String)` setters in the `WriteTable` and `ReadTable` builders are `@Deprecated`.
- The interfaces of the `GetNode` and `ListNode` request builders have been changed: `List<String>` is passed to the `setAttributes` method instead of `ColumnFilter`, the `null` argument represents `universal filter` (all attributes should be returned).
- Added the `useTLS` flag to `YTsaurusClientConfig`, if set to `true` `https` will be used for `discover_proxies`.

{% endcut %}


{% cut "**1.1.1**" %}

**Release date:** 2023-07-26


- Fixed validation of `@Entity` schemas: reading a subset of table columns, a superset of columns (if the types of the extra columns are `nullable`), writing a subset of columns (if the types of the missing columns are `nullable`).
- The following types are supported in `@Entity` fields:
     - `utf8` -> `String`;
     - `string` -> `byte[]`;
     - `uuid` -> `tech.ytsaurus.core.GUID`;
     - `timestamp` -> `java.time.Instant`.
- If an operation started by `SyncYTsaurusClient` fails, an exception will be thrown.
- Added the `ignoreBalancers` flag to `YTsaurusClientConfig`, which allows to ignore balancer addresses and find only rpc proxy addresses.
