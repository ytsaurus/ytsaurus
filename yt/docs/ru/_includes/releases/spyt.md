{% cut "**2.0.0**" %}

**Release date:** 2024-05-29


SPYT 2.0.0 is the first release under the new release scheme and in the separate ytsaurus-spyt repository. The main feature of this release is that we have finally switched from Apache Spark fork that was used in previous releases to original Apache Spark distributive. The 2.0.0 SPYT release is still using Apache Spark 3.2.2, but we plan to support all Apache Spark 3.x.x releases in the nearest future!

Other notable changes are:
- Support for direct submit on using Livy via Query Tracker;
- Split data-source module into data-source-base that uses standard Spark types for all YTsaurus types, and data-source-extended for our implementation of custom YTsaurus types that don't have direct matches in Spark type system;
- Support for direct submit from Jupyter notebooks;
- Custom UDT for YTsaurus datetime type.
