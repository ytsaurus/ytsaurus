# Users and groups synchronization

Sometimes it is required to keep users and group lists in sync with an external system. There is an app [ytsaurus-identity-sync](https://github.com/ytsaurus/ytsaurus-identity-sync) which might help when such an issue arises. The application periodically collects users, groups and memberships from the external system and updates {{product-name}} users and groups accordingly.

{% note warning %}

The `ytsaurus-identity-sync` application only allows synchronization in one direction — from an external source to the {{product-name}} system. Reverse synchronization from {{product-name}} to an external system is not supported.

{% endnote %}

The application supports importing users and groups from the two sources:
- Microsoft Entra (previously Azure Active Directory) via [Microsoft Graph REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/azuread-users-concept-overview).
- [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol).

More information on installation and configuration can be found in [application README](https://github.com/ytsaurus/ytsaurus-identity-sync?tab=readme-ov-file#installing).
