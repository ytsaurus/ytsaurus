# Setting up locations

For the {{product-name}} cluster to work, its components need disk space to store persistent, temporary, and debugging data. Paths to the file system directories intended for {{product-name}} are set in static configs of components generated by the K8s operator. In the {{product-name}} specification, paths are defined in the Locations section. Location types correspond to relevant components. Volumes are allocated to locations using standard Kubernetes concepts: `volumeMounts`, `volumes` (for non-persistent volumes), and `volumeClaimTemplates` (for persistent volumes).

## Location types { #location_types }

### MasterChangelogs, MasterSnapshots { #location_master }
Used to store master data, which includes all the cluster's metadata. These types must be placed on persistent volumes regardless of the installation size (except very small ones). The required volume size depends on the amount of metadata and the cluster load. Overloaded locations can make the cluster unavailable, which is why we recommend allocating some extra space and keeping an eye on its usage. Production installations are typically hundreds of gigabytes in size.

In order to ensure performance in production installations, we recommend placing `MasterChangelogs` on separate, fast (NVMe, for instance) volumes since logging latency directly impacts the latency of mutating requests submitted to the master.

Each master instance can and should have exactly one `MasterChangelogs` location and one `MasterSnapshots` location.

### ChunkCache, Slots { #locations_exec_nodes }
Used by exec nodes when initiating jobs that contain user code (Map, Reduce, Vanilla, including CHYT and SPYT). `ChunkCache` locations are used for managing and caching binary artifacts like executable files or auxiliary dictionaries. `Slots` locations are needed to allocate a temporary workspace (sandbox, scratch space) when running user processes. Each exec node must have at least one `ChunkCache` location and at least one `Slots` location. When allocating multiple `ChunkCache` or `Slots` locations for a single node, the exec node will try to balance the load between them.

Non-persistent volumes can be used for `ChunkCache` and `Slots` locations without compromising data reliability. Typical location sizes are 10–50 GB for `ChunkCache` and 5–200 GB for `Slots`.

### ChunkStore { #location_data_nodes }
Used by data nodes to store chunks. These types must be placed on persistent volumes regardless of the installation size (except very small ones). The size of the locations determines the total capacity of the cluster. When building a multi-tiered storage (containing different disk types, like HDD and SSD), specify the `medium` parameter in the location description. By default, the location is assigned to the `default` medium.

The minimum location size is 10 GB for a test installation and 100 GB for production. Each data node must have at least one `ChunkStore` location.

### Logs { #location_logs }
Used by all components to store logs. Setting these locations is optional. If you don't set any, logs are saved to `/var/log` within the container. You can use non-persistent volumes — this won't compromise data reliability but can complicate debugging when migrating or re-creating pods. Typical location sizes for production installations are 50–200 GB.

Each instance can have no more than one `Logs` location.

## Configuring volumes for K8s clusters without dynamic volume provisioning { #volumes_without_dvp }
There are two ways to mark up disks and create persistent volumes on clusters without dynamic provisioning for volumes:
* Using hostPath-type volumes
* Manually creating persistent volumes with [claimRef](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/persistent-volumes/preexisting-pd?authuser=0#pv_to_statefulset)

### Using hostPath volumes { #host_path_volumes }
Sample configuration for a homogeneous set of hosts with disks mounted in the ```/yt/chunk-store-hdd-1```, ```/yt/chunk-store-hdd-2```, and ```/yt/chunk-store-ssd-1``` directory.

```yaml
dataNodes:
  volumes:
    - name: chunk-store-hdd-1
      hostPath:
        path: /yt/chunk-store-hdd-1
    - name: chunk-store-hdd-2
      hostPath:
        path: /yt/chunk-store-hdd-2
    - name: chunk-store-ssd-1
      hostPath:
        path: /yt/chunk-store-ssd-1

  volumeMounts:
    - name: chunk-store-hdd-1
      mountPath: /yt/node-chunk-store-hdd-1
    - name: chunk-store-hdd-2
      mountPath: /yt/node-chunk-store-hdd-2
    - name: chunk-store-ssd-1
      mountPath: /yt/node-chunk-store-ssd-1

  locations:
    - locationType: ChunkStore
      # Location path can be a nested path of a volume mount.
      path: /yt/node-chunk-store-hdd-1/chunk_store
      medium: default
    - locationType: ChunkStore
      path: /yt/node-chunk-store-hdd-2/chunk_store
      medium: default
    - locationType: ChunkStore
      path: /yt/node-chunk-store-ssd-1/chunk_store
      medium: ssd_blobs
      # Place logs onto the first hdd disk, along with chunk store. Different locations may possibly share the same volume.
    - locationType: Logs
      path: /yt/node-chunk-store-hdd-1/logs
```
