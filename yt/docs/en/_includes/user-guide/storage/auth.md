# Authentication and passwords

To authenticate users, {{product-name}} allows setting user passwords for accessing the system. A password can be changed either by the system administrator or by the user in question. To manage a user's password, go to the password reset page or run the `set-user-password` command in the {{product-name}} CLI.

New users don't have a password, so their first password must be set by the administrator. Let's consider the following example:

```bash
$ yt create user --attr '{name=alex}'
$ yt set-user-password alex
New password: cone
Retype new password: cone
```

The administrator creates a new user named `alex` and sets their password to `cone`.

The user can then run the `set-user-password` command to change their password to `cube`.

```bash
$ yt set-user-password alex
Current password for alex: cone
New password: cube
Retype new password: cube
```

Note that unlike the administrator, the user is required to enter their current password in order to change it. The administrator doesn't need to enter any passwords, neither when setting the user password for the first time nor when changing it later.

## Token management

Users need tokens to interact with {{product-name}} via the CLI or the API. To facilitate token management, the CLI supports the `issue-token`, `revoke-token`, and `list-user-tokens` commands.

The `issue-token` command issues a new token to the user. Unlike with passwords, a single user can have multiple active tokens. This allows for seamless replacement of one token with another.

```bash
$ yt issue-token alex
Current password for alex: cone
"2c5956daecdff8dd45d2561a8679acf5"
```

User `alex` was issued token `2c5956daecdff8dd45d2561a8679acf5`. Similar to the `set-user-password` command, the user must specify their password, while the administrator isn't required to do so.

Use the `list-user-tokens` command to see the information about user's active tokens. Note that {{product-name}} doesn't store user tokens. In particular, the `list-user-tokens` command returns the SHA-256 hashes of tokens rather than the tokens themselves. For instance,

```bash
$ yt list-user-tokens alex
Current password for alex: cone
["87a5d9406ccf6a42cca510d86e43b20e2943aa7ade7e9129f4f4f947e1b02574"]

$ echo -n '2c5956daecdff8dd45d2561a8679acf5' | sha256sum
87a5d9406ccf6a42cca510d86e43b20e2943aa7ade7e9129f4f4f947e1b02574  -
```

With the `revoke-token` command, you can revoke the user's token. To revoke a token, you can specify either the token itself or its SHA-256 hash. The latter option allows using the output of the `list-user-tokens` command to revoke all tokens of that user.

```bash
$ yt revoke-token alex --token-sha256 87a5d9406ccf6a42cca510d86e43b20e2943aa7ade7e9129f4f4f947e1b02574
Current password for alex: cone
$ yt revoke-token alex --token 2c5956daecdff8dd45d2561a8679acf5
Current password for alex: cone
$ yt list-user-tokens alex
Current password for alex: cone
[]
```

{% note warning "Note" %}

Although the user password is required to manage a user's tokens, changing it doesn't automatically revoke the tokens. This means you can replace tokens gradually if the password is changed. If a user's password is compromised, it's highly recommended that you revoke all of their tokens once the new password has been set.
