# Distinctions of YQL SQL dialect from ANSI SQL

This section describes distinctions of YQL SQL dialect and the ISO/IEC 9075-2 standard (Part 2: Foundation) in the version SQL-2011.
To make the comparison, we took table 38 from the standard
("Feature taxonomy and definition for mandatory features").


## Distinctions in behavior between YQL and ANSI SQL

In this table, we've put together the scenarios where the same query produces different results in YQL and ANSI SQL.

| ID | Name | Behavioral distinctions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E011-04 | Arithmetic operators | YQL suppresses errors in arithmetic calculations. For example, the expression `1/0` has the type `Int32?` and the value `NULL`. ANSI SQL will throw an error in this case: |
| E011-06 | Implicit casting among the numeric data types | YQL doesn't provide implicit casting between NUMERIC and INTEGER/FLOAT. |
| E031-01 | Delimited identifiers | In YQL, the expression `SELECT "a" FROM foo` returns a string constant. In ANSI, `"a"` is treated as the ID (the `a` column) |
| E071-02 | UNION ALL table operator | In ANSI SQL, columns are joined according to their positions; in YQL, they are joined by names. Adding the `PositionalUnionAll` pragma enables the standard columnar execution for UNION ALL. In this case, column ordering is enabled automatically. |

#### E021 Character string types

Should be supported:
* `CHARACTER[(len)]` (aka `CHAR`): A string type of a fixed length.
* `VAR CHAR[(len)]` (aka `CHARACTER VARYING`): A string type of a variable length.

It should also support the optional specifier `CHARACTER SET cs` and setting sorting rules by `COLLATE`

These types aren't supported in YQL. The nearest analog is the `String` type
which is a binary string of a variable length.

##### E021-03 Character literals
According to the standard, string literals have the following format:
```
<character string literal> ::=
  [ <introducer> <character set specification> ]
      <quote> [ <character representation>... ] <quote>
      [ { <separator> <quote> [ <character representation>... ] <quote> }... ]
<separator> ::=
  { <comment> | <white space> }...
<introducer> ::=
  <underscore>
<character representation> ::=
    <nonquote character>
  | <quote symbol>
<quote symbol> ::=
  <quote> <quote>
```

In YQL:
* Escaping by `'` isn't supported
* `<Character set specification>` isn't supported
* Implicit concatenation of literals isn't supported (according to the standard, `'aaa' 'bbb'` means the same as `'aaabbb`)

On the other hand:
* You can enclose string literals into double quotes (`"aaa"`)
* C-style escaping by a backslash can also be used
* Multi-line string literals are supported

##### E021-05 OCTET_LENGTH function
```
CHARACTER_LENGTH(<character value expression>) [USING CHARACTERS | OCTETS]
OCTET_LENGTH(<string value expression>)
```
YQL suports `LENGTH(<string value expression>)` that returns the length of a string in bytes

##### E021-06 SUBSTRING function
```
<character substring function> ::=
  SUBSTRING <left paren> <character value expression> FROM <start position>
      [ FOR <string length> ] [ USING CHARACTERS | OCTETS ] <right paren>
```
In YQL, it's supported as `SUBSTRING(str, start, len)`.
Character numbering within a string in YQL begins with zero

##### E021-09 TRIM function
```
 TRIM([[LEADING | TRAILING | BOTH] [<char value expression>] FROM] <char value expression>)
```
Deleting a prefix or suffix from a string. Not supported in YQL; you can build a functional equivalent using a String/Unicode UDF.

##### E021-11 POSITION function
```
POSITION(S1 IN S2) [USING CHARACTERS | OCTETS]
```
Searching a substring S1 in a string S2.

Supported in YQL in the format `FIND(S2, S1)`. Positions are numbered beginning from 0. If the string isn't found, NULL is returned.

#### E031 Identifiers
According to the standard, the IDs (for example, table and column names) can be
regular identifiers and delimited identifiers.
Regular identifiers begin with a letter and can only include letters, digits, and underscores.


##### E031-01 Delimited identifiers
Delimited identifiers are enclosed in double quotes: `"abc def"` and can contain arbitrary characters.
Double quotes are escaped by double quotes: `"complex ""identifier"""`

Instead of double quotes, YQL uses backticks

#### E051 Basic query specification
According to the standard, the generic format of the SELECT statement is as follows
```
<query specification> ::=
  SELECT [ <set quantifier> ] <select list> <table expression>
<set quantifier> ::=
    DISTINCT
  | ALL
<select list> ::=
    <asterisk>
  | <select sublist> [ { <comma> <select sublist> }... ]
<select sublist> ::=
    <derived column>
  | <qualified asterisk>
<qualified asterisk> ::=
    <asterisked identifier chain> <period> <asterisk>
  | <all fields reference>
<asterisked identifier chain> ::=
  <asterisked identifier> [ { <period> <asterisked identifier> }... ]
<asterisked identifier> ::=
  <identifier>
<derived column> ::=
  <value expression> [ <as clause> ]
<as clause> ::=
  [ AS ] <column name>
<all fields reference> ::=
  <value expression primary> <period> <asterisk>
      [ AS <left paren> <all fields column name list> <right paren> ]
<all fields column name list> ::=
  <column name list>

<table expression> ::=
  <from clause>
      [ <where clause> ]
      [ <group by clause> ]
      [ <having clause> ]
      [ <window clause> ]
<from clause> ::=
  FROM <table reference list>
<table reference list> ::=
  <table reference> [ { <comma> <table reference> }... ]

```

YQL doesn't support multiple tables after `FROM` (`<table reference list>` includes more than one item)

##### E051-01 SELECT DISTINCT

SELECT DISTINCT is supported except for the variant with asterisk/qualified asterisk

##### E051-07 Qualified * in select list

In YQL:
* `<asterisk identifier chain>` can only consist of one item
* `<All fields reference>` doesn't support aliases `<all fields column name list>`
* `<Value expression primary>` can only include a link to a table


##### E061-01 Comparison predicate

YQL supports operators  <,>,=,<>,<=,>= for compatible types

##### E061-07 Quantified comparison predicate

```
<quantified comparison predicate> ::=
  <row value predicand> <quantified comparison predicate part 2>
<quantified comparison predicate part 2> ::=
  <comp op> <quantifier> <table subquery>
<quantifier> ::=
    <all>
  | <some>
<all> ::= ALL
<some> ::=
    SOME
  | ANY
```
