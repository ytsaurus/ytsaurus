# PRAGMA


## Definition

Redefinition of settings.

**Syntax**

`PRAGMA x.y = "z";` или `PRAGMA x.y("z", "z2", "z3");`:

* `x`: (optional) The category of the setting.
* `y`: The name of the setting.
* `z`: (optional for flags) The value of the setting. The following suffixes are acceptable:
   * `Kb`, `Mb`, `Gb`: For the data amounts.
   * `sec`,`min`, `h`, `d`: For the time values.

**Examples**

```yql
PRAGMA AutoCommit;
```

```yql
PRAGMA TablePathPrefix = "home/yql";
```

```yql
PRAGMA Warning("disable", "1101");
```

With some exceptions, you can return the settings values to their default states using `PRAGMA my_pragma = default;`.

For the complete list of available settings, [see the table below](#pragmas).

### Scope {#pragmascope}

Unless otherwise specified, a pragma affects all the subsequent expressions up to the end of the module where it's used.
If necessary and logically possible, you can change the value of this setting several times within a given query to make it different at different execution steps.
There are also special scoped pragmas with the scope defined by the same rules as the scope of [named expressions](expressions.md#named-nodes).
Unlike scoped pragmas, regular pragmas can only be used in the global scope of visibility (not inside lambda functions, ACTION, SUBQUERY, etc.).


## Global {#pragmas}

### AutoCommit {#autocommit}

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

Automatically perform [COMMIT](select.md#commit) after each expression.

### TablePathPrefix {#table-path-prefix}

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| String | — |

Add the specified prefix to the cluster table paths. Works on the same principle as merging paths in a file system: supports references to the parent catalog `..` and doesn't require adding a slash to the right. For example,

`PRAGMA TablePathPrefix = "home/yql";
SELECT * FROM test;`

The prefix is not added if the table name is an absolute path (starts with /).

### UseTablePrefixForEach {#use-table-prefix-for-each}

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

EACH uses [TablePathPrefix](#table-path-prefix) for each list item.

### Warning {#warning}

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Action<br>2. Warning code or "*" | — |

Action:
* `disable`: Disable.
* `error`: Treat as an error.
* `default`: Revert to the default behavior.

The warning code is returned with the text itself (it's displayed on the right side of the web interface).

Example:
`PRAGMA Warning("error", "*");`
`PRAGMA Warning("disable", "1101");`
`PRAGMA Warning("default", "4503");`

In this case, all the warnings are treated as errors, except for the warning `1101` (that will be disabled) and `4503` (that will be processed by default, that is, remain a warning). Since warnings may be added in new YQL releases, use `PRAGMA Warning("error", "*");` with caution (at least cover such queries with autotests).


[List of warning and error codes](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/blob/main/ydb/core/protos/issue_id.proto)


### Greetings {#greetings}

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Text | — |

Issue the specified text as the query's Info message.

Example:
`PRAGMA Greetings("It's a good day!");`

### WarningMsg {#warningmsg}

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Text | — |

Issue the specified text as the query's Warning message.

Example:
`PRAGMA WarningMsg("Attention!");`

### DqEngine {#dqengine}

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| disable/auto/force string | "auto" |

When set to "auto", it enables a new compute engine. Computing is made, whenever possible, without creating map/reduce operations. The "force" value unconditionally routes calculations to the new engine.

### SimpleColumns {#simplecolumns}

`SimpleColumns` / `DisableSimpleColumns`

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | true |

If using `SELECT foo.* FROM ... AS foo`, delete the `foo.`  prefix from the names of the resulting columns.

It also works for [JOIN](join.md), but in this case it may crash if there's a name conflict (which can be resolved through [WITHOUT](select.md#without) and renaming columns). For JOIN in SimpleColumns mode, an implicit Coalesce is made for key columns: the query `SELECT * FROM T1 AS a JOIN T2 AS b USING(key)` in the SimpleColumns mode works same as `SELECT a.key ?? b.key AS key, ... FROM T1 AS a JOIN T2 AS b USING(key)`

### CoalesceJoinKeysOnQualifiedAll

`CoalesceJoinKeysOnQualifiedAll` / `DisableCoalesceJoinKeysOnQualifiedAll`

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | true |

Controls implicit Coalesce for the key `JOIN` columns in the SimpleColumns mode. If the flag is set, the Coalesce is made for key columns if there is at least one expression in the format `foo.*` or `*` in SELECT: for example, `SELECT a.* FROM T1 AS a JOIN T2 AS b USING(key)`. If the flag is not set, then Coalesce for JOIN keys is made only if there is an asterisk '*' after `SELECT`

### StrictJoinKeyTypes
`StrictJoinKeyTypes` / `DisableStrictJoinKeyTypes`

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

If the flag is set, [JOIN](join.md) will require a strict match of key types.
By default, JOIN preconverts keys to a shared type, which might result in performance degradation.
StrictJoinKeyTypes is a [scoped](#pragmascope) setting.


### AnsiInForEmptyOrNullableItemsCollections

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

This pragma brings the behavior of the `IN` operator in accordance with the standard when there's `NULL` in the left or right side of `IN`. The behavior of `IN` when on the right side there is a Tuple with elements of different types also changed. Examples:

`1 IN (2, 3, NULL) = NULL (was Just(False))`
`NULL IN () = Just(False) (was NULL)`
`(1, null) IN ((2, 2), (3, 3)) = Just(False) (was NULL)`
`2147483648u IN (1, 2147483648u) = True (was False)`

For more information about the `IN` behavior when operands include `NULL`s, see [here](expressions.md#in). You can explicitly select the old behavior by specifying the pragma `DisableAnsiInForEmptyOrNullableItemsCollections`. If no pragma is set, then a warning is issued and the old version works.

### AnsiRankForNullableKeys

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

Aligns the RANK/DENSE_RANK behavior with the standard if there are optional types in the window sort keys or in the argument of such window functions. It means that:
* The result type is always Uint64 rather than Uint64?;
* NULLs in keys are treated as equal to each other (the current implementation returns NULL).
   You can explicitly select the old behavior by using the `DisableAnsiRankForNullableKeys` pragma. If no pragma is set, then a warning is issued and the old version works.

### AnsiCurrentRow

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

If ORDER BY is present, the implicit window frame task is brought into conformity with the standard.
If AnsiCurrentRow is not set, the `(ORDER BY key)` window is equivalent to `(ORDER BY key ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`.
The standard requires that such window behaves as `(ORDER BY key RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`.
The difference is in `CURRENT ROW` interpretation. In `ROWS` mode, `CURRENT ROW` is interpreted literally: the current string in the partition.
And in `RANGE` mode, the end of the `CURRENT ROW` frame means "the last row in the partition with the sorting key equal to the current row".

### DisableAnsiOptionalAs

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

With this pragma, syntax error will be raised for queries wherein the fields are not separated by commas.
The following query:
```
SELECT
    field1 -- no "," here
    field2
FROM (
    select 1 AS field1
);
```
will raise "Expecting mandatory AS here. Did you miss comma?" error.

### OrderedColumns {#orderedcolumns}
`OrderedColumns` / `DisableOrderedColumns`

Output the [sequence of columns](select.md#orderedcolumns) to SELECT/JOIN/UNION ALL and save it when recording the results. The order of columns is undefined by default.

### PositionalUnionAll {#positionalunionall}

Enable the standard column-by-column execution for [UNION ALL](select.md#unionall). In this case,
[column ordering](#orderedcolumns) is enabled automatically.

### RegexUseRe2

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

Use Re2 UDF instead of Pcre for executing `REGEX`,`MATCH`,`RLIKE`, and SQL operators. Re2 UDF supports correct processing of Unicode symbols, unlike Pcre UDF, which is used by default.

### ClassicDivision

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | true |

In the classical version, the result of integer division remains integer (by default).
If disabled, the result is always Double.
ClassicDivision is a [scoped](#pragmascope) setting.

### CheckedOps

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

When the mode is enabled, if integers go beyond the limits of the target argument type or result when performing SUM/SUM_IF, `+`,`-`,`*`,`/`,`%` binary operations, or unary operation`-`, then `NULL` is returned.
If disabled, overflow is not checked.
Has no effect on floating point or `Decimal` numbers.
CheckedOps is a [scoped](#pragmascope) setting.

### AllowDotInAlias

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

Enable dot in names of result columns. This behavior is disabled by default, since the further use of such columns in JOIN is not fully implemented.

### WarnUnnamedColumns

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

Generate a warning if a column name was automatically generated for an unnamed expression in `SELECT` (in the format `column[0-9]+`).

### GroupByLimit

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Positive number | 32 |

Increasing the limit on the number of dimensions in [GROUP BY](group_by.md).


### GroupByCubeLimit

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Positive number | 5 |

Increasing the limit on the number of dimensions in [GROUP BY](group_by.md#rollup-cube-group-sets).

Use this option with care, because the computational complexity of the query grows exponentially with the number of dimensions.




## Yson

Management of Yson UDF default behavior. To learn more, see [documentation](../udf/list/yson.md), in particular, [Yson::Options](../udf/list/yson.md#ysonoptions).

### `yson.AutoConvert`

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

Automatic conversion of values to the required data type in all Yson UDF calls, including implicit calls.

### `yson.Strict`

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | true |

Strict mode control in all Yson UDF calls, including implicit calls. If the value is omitted or is `"true"`, it enables the strict mode. If the value is `"false"`, it disables the strict mode.

### `yson.DisableStrict`

| Value type | By default |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | false |

An inverted version of `yson.Strict`. If the value is omitted or is `"true"`, it disables the strict mode. If the value is `"false"`, it enables the strict mode.


## Working with files

### File

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Two or three string arguments — alias, URL, and optional token name | — | Static |

Attach a file to the query by URL. For attaching files you can use the built-in functions `FilePath` and `FileContent`. This `PRAGMA` is a universal alternative to attaching files using built-in mechanisms of web or console clients.

YQL reserves the right to cache files at the URL for an indefinite period, hence, if there is a significant change in the content behind it, we strongly recommended to modify the URL by adding/editing dummy parameters.

When specifying the token name, its value will be used to access the target system.

### Folder

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Two or three string arguments — prefix, URL, and optional token name | — | Static |

Attach a set of files to the query by URL. Functions similar to adding a set of files using [PRAGMA File](#file) via direct links to files with aliases obtained by joining a prefix with the file name via `/`.

When specifying the token name, its value will be used to access the target system.

### Library

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One or two arguments: the file name and an optional URL | — | Static |

Treat the specified attached file as a library from which you can do [IMPORT](export_import.md). The syntax type for the library is determined from the file extension:
* `.sql`: For the YQL dialect of SQL <span style="color: green;">(recommended)</span>.
* `.yql` for [s-expressions](/docs/s_expressions).

Example with a file attached to the query:

```yql
PRAGMA library("a.sql");
IMPORT a SYMBOLS $x;
SELECT $x;
```

If the URL is specified, the library is downloaded from the URL rather than from the pre-attached file as in the following example:

```yql
PRAGMA library("a.sql","https://paste.yandex-team.ru/5618566/text");
IMPORT a SYMBOLS $x;
SELECT $x;
```

In this case, you can use text parameter value substitution in the URL:

```yql
DECLARE $_ver AS STRING; -- "5618566"
PRAGMA library("a.sql","https://paste.yandex-team.ru/{$_ver}/text");
IMPORT a SYMBOLS $x;
SELECT $x;
```




## {{product-name}} {#yt}

{{product-name}} pragmas may be defined as static or dynamic based on their lifetimes. Static pragmas are initialized one time at the earliest query processing step. If a static pragma is specified multiple times in a query, it accepts the latest value set for it. Dynamic pragma values are initialized at the query execution step after its optimization and roadmap development. The specified value is valid until the next identical pragma is found or until the query is completed. For dynamic pragmas only, you can reset their values to the default by assigning a `default`. All pragmas that affect query optimizers are static because dynamic pragma values haven't yet been calculated at this step.

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |

### `UDF`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String | — | Static |
| String — prefix name appended to all modules | "" | Static |

Importing all UDFs from the shared library (.so) compiled in Linux x64 that is attached to the query.
When setting a prefix, it's appended before the names of all loaded modules, e.g. CustomPrefixIp::IsIPv4 instead of Ip::IsIPv4.
Setting the prefix lets you load the same UDF for different versions.

### `yt.InferSchema` / `yt.ForceInferSchema` {#inferschema}

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A number from 1 to 1,000 | — | Static |

Outputting the data schema based on the contents of the table's first rows. If PRAGMA is specified without a value, the contents of only the first row is used. If multiple rows are specified and column data types differ, they are extended to Yson.

InferSchema includes outputting data schemas for those tables only where it's not specified in metadata at all. When using ForceInferSchema, the data schema from metadata is ignored except for the list of key columns for sorted tables.

In addition to the detected column, dictionary column _other (row-on-row) is generated, which contains values for those columns that weren't in the first row but were found somewhere else. This lets you use `WeakField` for such tables.

Due to a wide range of issues that may arise, this mode isn't recommended for use and is disabled by default.

### `yt.InferSchemaTableCountThreshold`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Positive number | 50 | Static |

If the number of tables for which the schema is outputted based on their contents exceeds the specified value, then schema outputting is initiated as a separate operation on {{product-name}}, which may happen much faster.

### `yt.IgnoreWeakSchema`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flag | false | Static |

Ignore the table's weak schema (produced by sorting a non-schematized table based on a set of fields).

Together with `yt.InferSchema`, you can output data-based schemas for such tables.

### `yt.IgnoreYamrDsv`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flag | false | Static |

Ignore `_format=yamred_dsv` if it's specified in the input table's metadata.

### `yt.IgnoreTypeV3` {#ignoretypev3}

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flag | false | Static |

When reading tables with type_v3 schema, all fields containing complex types will be displayed as Yson fields in the query. Complex types include all non-data types and data types with more than one level of optionality.

### `yt.StaticPool`

### `yt.QueryCacheMode` {#querycache}

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String: disable / readonly / refresh / normal | normal | Static |

Cache operates at the level of MapReduce operations:
* Cache is disabled in **disable** mode.
* **readonly** — read permissions only. No writes allowed.
* **refresh** — write-only. No reads are allowed. A query error is generated if an error occurs during parallel write to the cache from another transaction.
* **normal** — read and write permissions. If an error occurs during parallel write to the cache from another transaction, assume that the same data was written and continue your work.
   In **normal** and **refresh** mode, the output for each operation is additionally stored in `//<tmp_folder>/query_cache/<hash>`, where:
* tmp_folder — defaults to `tmp/<login>` or [PRAGMA yt.TmpFolder](#yt.tmpfolder) value;
* hash — hash of input tables' meaningful metadata and the logical program that ran in the operation.
   In **normal** and **readonly** mode, this path is calculated for the MapReduce operation just before its launch. Depending on the selected caching mode, the operation may either be launched or instantly marked as successful using the prepared table instead of its outcome. If an expression contains nondeterministic functions like Random/RandomNumber/RandomUuid/CurrentUtcDate/CurrentUtcDatetime/CurrentUtcTimestamp, the cache for this operation is disabled. All UDFs are currently considered deterministic, meaning they don't interfere with caching. If a non-deterministic UDF must be used, you should specify an additional Uint64-type argument and pass `CurentUtcTimestamp()` to it. Use of arguments is not mandatory in this case.

### `yt.QueryCacheIgnoreTableRevision`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flag | false | Static |

If the flag is set, {{product-name}} revision is excluded from metadata during hash calculation<!--(../../../user-guide/storage/cypress.md)-->. Therefore, QueryCache is not invalidated when modifying input table contents.
The mode is primarily intended for speeding up the complex queries debugging process in large, modifiable tables where query logic can't ignore these modifications.

From_master mode works very fast but provides simplified statistics. Fallback mode works as a combination of the previous two.

### `yt.MapJoinLimit`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes | 2,048M | Static |

| Flag | - | Static |

Explicit management in selecting the primary table in a Reduce operation with the Ordered JOIN strategy. If the value is set as True, then the smaller side will always be selected as the primary table. If the flag value is False, the larger side will be selected, except when unique keys are available on the larger side. Selecting a larger table as the primary table is safe, even if the table contains monster keys. However, it will run slower. If this pragma isn't set, the primary table is selected automatically based on the maximum size of the resulting jobs (see yt.JoinMergeReduceJobMaxSize).

### `yt.JoinMergeReduceJobMaxSize`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes | 8G | Static |

### `yt.JoinMergeForce`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flag | - | Static |

Forces selection of the Ordered JOIN strategy. If the flag is set to True, the Ordered JOIN strategy is selected even if a single JOIN side or both JOIN sides are unsorted. In this case, unsorted sides are pre-sorted. The maximum size of the unsorted table (see `yt.JoinMergeUnsortedFactor`) is unlimited in this case.

### `yt.JoinAllowColumnRenames`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flag | true | Static |

### `yt.MinPublishedAvgChunkSize`

| Value type | By default | Static/<br/>dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bytes | — | Static |

If the average chunk size in the resulting output table is smaller than the specified setting, then an additional {{product-name}} Merge operation is launched that enlarges the chunks to reach the specified size. The value of 0 has a special meaning. In this case, Merge is always launched to enlarge the chunks up to 1G.
If the table uses the compression codec, then the chunk output size may differ from the specified one by the compression factor value. This pragma sets the data size per merge job. The output size may be significantly smaller after compression. In this case, you should increase the pragma value by the expected compression factor value.

### `yt.MinTempAvgChunkSize`
