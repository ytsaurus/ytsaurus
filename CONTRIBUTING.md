# Notice to external contributors

## Common

YTsaurus is a free and open project and we appreciate to receive contributions from our community.

## Contributing code changes

If you would like to contribute a new feature or a bug fix, please discuss your idea first on the GitHub issue.
If there is no issue for your idea, please open one. It may be that somebody is already working on it,
or that there are some complex obstacles that you should know about before starting the implementation.
Usually there are several ways to fix a problem and it is important to find the right approach before spending time on a PR
that cannot be merged.  We add the `help wanted` label to existing GitHub issues for which community
contributions are particularly welcome, and we use the `good first issue` label to mark issues that we think will be suitable for new contributors.

## Provide a contribution

To make a contribution you should submit a pull request. There will probably be discussion about the pull request and,
if any changes are needed, we would love to work with you to get your pull request merged.

## Other questions

If you have any questions, please mail us at info@ytsaurus.tech.
