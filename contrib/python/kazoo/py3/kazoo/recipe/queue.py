    as compared to :class:`Queue` implementation.

    call the :meth:`LockingQueue.consume` method that will remove the entry

    an element, then loses connection with ZooKeeper and later reconnects, the
    lock will probably be removed by Zookeeper in the meantime, but a node
    would still think that it holds a lock. The user should check the
