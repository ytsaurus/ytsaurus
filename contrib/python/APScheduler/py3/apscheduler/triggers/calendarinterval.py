class CalendarIntervalTrigger(BaseTrigger):
    """
    Runs the task on specified calendar-based intervals always at the same exact time of
    day.

    When calculating the next date, the ``years`` and ``months`` parameters are first
    added to the previous date while keeping the day of the month constant. This is
    repeated until the resulting date is valid. After that, the ``weeks`` and ``days``
    parameters are added to that date. Finally, the date is combined with the given time
    (hour, minute, second) to form the final datetime.

    This means that if the ``days`` or ``weeks`` parameters are not used, the task will
    always be executed on the same day of the month at the same wall clock time,
    assuming the date and time are valid.

    If the resulting datetime is invalid due to a daylight saving forward shift, the
    date is discarded and the process moves on to the next date. If instead the datetime
    is ambiguous due to a backward DST shift, the earlier of the two resulting datetimes
    is used.

    If no previous run time is specified when requesting a new run time (like when
    starting for the first time or resuming after being paused), ``start_date`` is used
    as a reference and the next valid datetime equal to or later than the current time
    will be returned. Otherwise, the next valid datetime starting from the previous run
    time is returned, even if it's in the past.

    .. warning:: Be wary of setting a start date near the end of the month (29. â€“ 31.)
        if you have ``months`` specified in your interval, as this will skip the months
        when those days do not exist. Likewise, setting the start date on the leap day
        (February 29th) and having ``years`` defined may cause some years to be skipped.

        Users are also discouraged from  using a time inside the target timezone's DST
        switching period (typically around 2 am) since a date could either be skipped or
        repeated due to the specified wall clock time either occurring twice or not at
        all.
