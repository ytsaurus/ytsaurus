The ``zope.event`` package provides a simple event system, including:

- An event publishing API, intended for use by applications which are
  unaware of any subscribers to their events.

- A very simple synchronous event-dispatching system, on which more sophisticated
  event dispatching systems can be built. For example, a type-based
  event dispatching system that builds on ``zope.event`` can be found in
  ``zope.component``.

Please see http://zopeevent.readthedocs.io/ for the documentation.
