# libaio

The Linux-native asynchronous I/O facility ("async I/O", or "aio") has a
richer API and capability set than the simple POSIX async I/O facility.
This library, libaio, provides the Linux-native API for async I/O.
The POSIX async I/O facility requires this library in order to provide
kernel-accelerated async I/O capabilities, as do applications which
require the Linux-native async I/O API.
