To install the library, execute the command:

	make prefix=`pwd`/usr install

which will install the binaries and header files into the directory 
usr.  Set prefix=/usr to get them installed into the main system.

Please note:  Do not attempt to install on the system the
"libredhat-kernel.so" file.  It is a dummy shared library
provided only for the purpose of being able to bootstrap
this facility while running on systems without the correct
libredhat-kernel.so built.  The contents of the included
libredhat-kernel.so are only stubs; this library is NOT
functional for anything except the internal purpose of
linking libaio.so against the provided stubs.  At runtime,
libaio.so requires a real libredhat-kernel.so library; this
is provided by the Red Hat kernel RPM packages with async
I/O functionality.
