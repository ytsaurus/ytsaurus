 * t1ha = { Fast Positive Hash, aka "Позитивный Хэш" }
 * by [Positive Technologies](https://www.ptsecurity.ru)
 *
 * Briefly, it is a 64-bit Hash Function:
 *  1. Created for 64-bit little-endian platforms, in predominantly for x86_64,
 *     but portable and without penalties it can run on any 64-bit CPU.
 *  2. In most cases up to 15% faster than City64, xxHash, mum-hash, metro-hash
 *     and all others portable hash-functions (which do not use specific
 *     hardware tricks).
 *  3. Not suitable for cryptography.
 *
 * The Future will (be) Positive. Всё будет хорошо.
 *
 * ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
 * The t1ha was originally developed by Leonid Yuriev (Леонид Юрьев)
 * for The 1Hippeus project - zerocopy messaging in the spirit of Sparta!
