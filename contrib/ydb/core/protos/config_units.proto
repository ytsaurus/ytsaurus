// this file contains only structures used to describe different values expressed in corresponding units in configuration

// universal duration structure; resulting TDuration is obtained by summing all present values with their respective
// weights; thus, you can define struct like "Duration { Seconds: 5 Milliseconds: 500 }" or
// "Duration { Milliseconds: 5500 }", which has exactly the same duration value as the first one
