/**
 * Class to organize ordered transactions execution. Single
 * processor executes transactions in a strict order only one
 * at a time.
 *
 * Multiple processors may be linked into a tree. Each tree
 * node can start new transaction in case there is no parent
 * running tx or having tx in its queue and no child running
 * tx. Thus tree root executes global transactions which have
 * exclusive state ownership and never intersect with other
 * transactions. Leaf nodes refer to more local transactions
 * (e.g. transaction for some tenant) which may go in parallel.
 *
 * New processor may be created by simply calling
 * GetSubProcessor method. If processor is not going to have
 * more sub-processors and is likely to have no more transactions
 * in the nearest future then it is reasonable to mark it as
 * a temporary processor. Temporary processor is automatically
 * unlinked from parent processor once it has no transactions
 * to run and no live sub-processors.
 *
 * Console tablet uses following processors organization:
 *   'console'       - root permanent processor used for state
 *    |                load, tablet config updates
 *    |-'configs'    - permanent processor used for all config
 *    |                updates
 *    |-'tenants'    - permanent processor used for all tenant
 *                     transactions
